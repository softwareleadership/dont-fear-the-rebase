## Shared vs. Forked Repositories

### Shared Repositories

When working in a shared repository, many teams adopt a Git Flow style such as the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). This may involve PRs based directly off of the `main` branch, or may involve an additional `dev` or `develop` branch.

### Forked Repositories

From [GitHub Forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

> When a repo is cloned, it has a default remote called origin that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repo it was forked from.
>
> To keep track of the original repo, you need to add another remote named upstream

From [Stack Overflow - What is the difference between origin and upstream on GitHub?
